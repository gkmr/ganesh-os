# UI Kit — One day in motion (digest)

A phone recreation of the Ganesh OS daily arc from `demo.html`: the overnight sweep, the 7:42 morning brief, the operator's one-word replies, and the evening scorecard. Composes this system's messaging primitives.

## Run it
Open `index.html`. Use the segmented control or "Advance the day →" to step through the four moments.

## Surfaces
- `OneDay.jsx` — a phone frame plus a 4-step thread: `MessageBubble` (overnight + the reply exchange), `DayPlan` (the 7:42 brief), `DomainScorecard` (that night). Stepper driven by SegmentedControl + Button.

## Components composed
MessageBubble, DayPlan, DomainScorecard, SegmentedControl, Button.

## Interactions
Stepping forward reveals each moment; the reply step shows the cheap "done M51 / push the lift to 7" exchange. Reduced-motion safe (entrance fades only).

## Fidelity notes
Mirrors the structure and copy voice of the repo's `demo.html` and `samples/` (morning-brief, scorecard, digest-sms). Names and counts are generalized, exactly as the source samples are sanitized.
